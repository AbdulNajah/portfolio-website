I'm Najah, a data scientist specialising in the intersection of remote sensing and machine learning. With a strong background in spatial data analysis and image processing, I thrive on extracting meaningful insights from satellite imagery. From assessing urban growth patterns to detecting burned areas, I've applied advanced algorithms to tackle diverse projects. As a Teaching Fellow and Teaching Assistant, I've had the privilege of guiding and mentoring students, helping them grasp complex data science concepts. I'm actively seeking new opportunities where I can apply my skills and expertise to make a tangible impact in the field.
