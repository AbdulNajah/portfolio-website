I am a data scientist with a keen interest in using remote sensing and machine learning to solve real-world problems. I graduated from Ashoka University in India with a liberal arts degree, and I have worked on data science projects in the domains of policy, urbanisation, climate, and sustainability. Currently, I work as a data science consultant for an earth observation start up. I've always enjoyed teaching and mentoring others, so I jumped at the chance to share my data science knowledge by getting involved as a part-time teaching assistant for the Professional and Executive Development Programme at the Ashoka Centre for Data Science and Analytics. Now I'm keeping an eye out for new opportunities to apply my geospatial data science skills!
